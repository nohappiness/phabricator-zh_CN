However, you may want to search first if:\n\n  - You want users to be able to login with either their username     or their email address.\n  - The login/username is not part of the distinguished name in     your LDAP records.\n  - You want to restrict logins to a subset of users (like only     those in certain departments).\n  - Your LDAP server is configured in some other way that prevents     direct binding from working correctly.\n\n**To bind directly**, enter the LDAP attribute corresponding to the login name into the **Search Attributes** box below. Often, this is something like `sn` or `uid`. This is the simplest configuration, but will only work if the username is part of the distinguished name, and won\'t let you apply complex restrictions to logins.\n\n  lang=text,name=Simple Direct Binding\n  sn\n\n**To search first**, provide an anonymous username and password below (or check the **Always Search** checkbox), then enter one or more search queries into this field, one per line. After binding, these queries will be used to identify the record associated with the login name the user typed.\n\nSearches will be tried in order until a matching record is found. Each query can be a simple attribute name (like `sn` or `mail`), which will search for a matching record, or it can be a complex query that uses the string `${login}` to represent the login name.\n\nA common simple configuration is just an attribute name, like `sn`, which will work the same way direct binding works:\n\n  lang=text,name=Simple Example\n  sn\n\nA slightly more complex configuration might let the user login with either their login name or email address:\n\n  lang=text,name=Match Several Attributes\n  mail\n  sn\n\nIf your LDAP directory is more complex, or you want to perform sophisticated filtering, you can use more complex queries. Depending on your directory structure, this example might allow users to login with either their email address or username, but only if they\'re in specific departments:\n\n  lang=text,name=Complex Example\n  (&(mail=${login})(|(departmentNumber=1)(departmentNumber=2)))\n  (&(sn=${login})(|(departmentNumber=1)(departmentNumber=2)))\n\nAll of the attribute names used here are just examples: your LDAP server may use different attribute names.' => null,

  'Your MySQL instance is using the builtin stopword file for building search indexes. This can make Phabricator\'s search feature less useful.\n\nStopwords are common words which are not indexed and thus can not be searched for. The default stopword file has about 500 words, including various words which you are likely to wish to search for, such as \'various\', \'likely\', \'wish\', and \'zero\'.\n\nTo make search more useful, you can use an alternate stopword file with fewer words. Alternatively, if you aren\'t concerned about searching for common words, you can ignore this warning.
